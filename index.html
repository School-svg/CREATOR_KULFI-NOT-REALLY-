        RESOURCES
        IMPORTANT POINTS;
        <p></p>1]everything that available in our environment which can be used to satisfy our needs, provided,
        accessible,
        economically feasible and culturally acceptable can be termed as resource.
        <p></p>2]classification; on the basis of origin- biotic and abiotic
        On the basis of exhaustibility- rnewable and non renewable
        On the basis of ownership- individual, community, national and international
        On the basis of status of development- potential, developed, stock and reserves
        <p></p>3]biotic :things obtained from biosphere and have life such has human beings is known as biotic.
        4]abiotic: things which are composed from non living things are called abiotic.
        <p></p>5]renewable resources:
        the resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical, chemical or mechanical process is known as
        renewable or replenishable resource.
        <p> 6]non renewable resources: the resources which occour over a very long geological time is known as non
            renewable
            resource.
            <p></p>7]individual resource: the resources which are owned by individual people privately Is known as
            individual
            resources.
            <p></p>8]community owned resources: the resources which are accessible to a group of people is known as
            community owned
            resources,
            <p> </p>7]national resources: the resources which belong to the nation is known as national resources.
            <p></p>8]international resources: the resources which belong to the the international is known as
            international
            resources.
            <p></p>9]india has got the right to mine manganese from the bed of the Indian ocean from the area which lies
            beyond the
            exclusive economic zone.
            <p></p>10]potential resources: resources which are found in an region but not utilized is known as potential
            resources.
            <p></p>11]developed resources: resources which are surveyed and their quality and quantity have been
            determined for
            uitilization is known as developed resources.
            <p></p>12]stock: material sin the environment which have the potential to satisfy human needs but human
            beings do not
            have the appropriate technology to access these are known as stock.
            <p></p>13]reserves: these are the subset of the stock which can be put into use with the help of existing
            technical
            ‘know-how’ their use has not been started. These can be use for meeting future requirements.
            <p></p>14]problems coming by over usage of resources:
            <p></p>1]depletion of resources for satisfying the greed of a few individuals .
            <p></p>2]accumulation of resources In few hands, which, intern, divided the society into 2 segments that is
            haves and
            have nots and rich and poor.
            <p></p>3]indiscriminate explosion of resources has led to global ecological crises such as, global warming,
            ozone layer
            depletion, environmental pollution and land degradation.
            <p></p>15]sustainable existence is a component of sustainable development.
            <p></p>16]sustainable development: sustainable economic development means ‘development should and place
            without
            damaging the environment, and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of the future
            generations.
            <p></p>17]in June 1992, more than 100 heads of states met in rio de janeiro in brazil, for the first
            international
            earth summit.
            <p></p>18]agenda 21:it aims at achieving global sustainable development.it is an agenda to combat
            environmental damage,
            poverty, disease through global co-operation on common interest, mutual needs and shared responsibilities.
            One
            major objective of the agenda 21 is that every local government should draw its own local agenda 21
            <p></p>19]resource planning is a complex process which involves:
            <p></p>1]identification and inventory of resource across the regions of the country.
            <p></p>2]evolving a planning structure endowed with appropriate technology, skill and institutional set up
            for
            implementing resource development plans.
            <p></p>3]matching the resource development plans with overall national development plans.
            <p></p>20]the history of colonization reveals that rich resources in colonies were the main attraction for
            the foreign
            invaders.
            <p></p>21]resources are vital for any development activity. But irrational consumption and over-utilization
            of
            resources may lead to socio-economic and environmental problems. To overcome these problems, resource
            conservation at various levels is important.
            <p></p>22]Gandhiji’s concern about resource conservation in these words ‘there is enough for everybody s
            need and not
            for any body s greed’.
            <p></p>23]Club of Rome was the first one to advocate resource conservation for the first time in a more
            systematic way
            in 1968.
            <p></p>24]in 1974 Gandhian philosophy was once again presented by Schumacher in his book ‘SMALL IS
            BEAUTIFUL’
            <p></p>25] LAND UTILISATION
            Land resources are used for the following
            purposes:
            <p></p>1. Forests
            <p></p>2. Land not available for cultivation
            <p></p>(a) Barren and waste land
            <p></p>(b) Land put to non-agricultural uses, e.g.
            buildings, roads, factories, etc.
            <p></p>3. Other uncultivated land (excluding
            fallow land)
            <p></p>(a) Permanent pastures and grazing land,
            <p></p> (b) Land under miscellaneous tree crops
            groves (not included in net sown area),
            <p></p>(c) Cultruable waste land (left
            uncultivated for more than 5
            agricultural years).
            <p></p>4. Fallow lands
            <p></p>(a) Current fallow-(left without cultivation
            for one or less than one agricultural year),
            <p></p>(b) Other than current fallow-(left
            uncultivated for the past 1 to 5
            agricultural years).
            <p></p>5. Net sown area
            A rea sown more than once in an
            agricultural year plus net sown area is
            known as gross cropped area.
            <p></p> 26]net sown area[nsa]
            <p></p>27] The use of land is determined both by physical
            factors such as topography, climate, soil types
            as well as human factors such as population
            density, technological capability and culture
            and traditions etc.
            <p></p> 28]total Geographyical area of India is 3.28 million sq km.
            <p></p>29] The pattern of net sown area varies greatly from one state to another. It is over 80 per cent of
            the
            total
            area in Punjab and Haryana and less than 10 per cent in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Manipur and Andaman
            Nicobar
            Islands.
            <p></p>30] Some human activities such as deforestation, over grazing, mining and quarrying too have
            contributed
            significantly in land degradation. There are many ways to solve the problems of land degradation.
            Afforestation
            and proper management of grazing can help to some extent. Planting of shelter belts of plants, control on
            over
            grazing, stabilisation of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes are some of the methods to check land
            degradation
            in arid areas. Proper management of waste lands, control of mining activities, proper discharge and disposal
            of
            industrial effluents and wastes after treatment can reduce land and water degradation in industrial and
            suburban
            area.
            <p></p>31] Alluvial Soils This is the most widely spread and important soil. In fact, the entire northern
            plains
            are
            made of alluvial soil. These have been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems – the Indus, the
            Ganga and the Brahmaputra. These soils also extend in Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow corridor.
            Alluvial
            soil is also found in the eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari,
            the
            Krishna and the Kaveri rivers. The alluvial soil consists of various proportions of sand, silt and clay. As
            we
            move inlands towards the river valleys, soil particles appear some what bigger in size. In the upper reaches
            of
            the river valley i.e. near the place of the break of slope, the soils are coarse. Such soils are more common
            in
            piedmont plains such as Duars, Chos and Terai. Apart from the size of their grains or components, soils are
            also
            described on the basis of their age. According to their age alluvial soils can be classified as old alluvial
            (Bangar) and new alluvial (Khadar). The bangar soil has higher concentration ofkanker nodules than the
            Khadar.
            It has more fine particles and is more fertile than the bangar. Alluvial soils as a whole are very fertile.
            Mostly these soils contain adequate proportion of potash, phosphoric acid and lime which are ideal for the
            growth of sugarcane, paddy, wheat and other cereal and pulse crops. Due to its high fertility, regions of
            alluvial soils are intensively cultivated and densely populated. Soils in the drier areas are more alkaline
            and
            can be productive after proper treatment and irrigation.
            <p></p>32] Black Soil These soils are black in colour and are also known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal
            for
            growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil. It is believed that climatic condition along with the
            parent rock material are the important factors for the formation of black soil. This type of soil is typical
            of
            the Deccan trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. They
            cover
            the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east
            direction along the Godavari and the Krishna valleys. The black soils are made up of extremely fine i.e.
            clayey
            material. They are well-known for their capacity to hold moisture. In addition, they are rich in soil
            nutrients,
            such as calcium carbonate, magnesium, potash and lime. These soils are generally poor in phosphoric
            contents.
            They develop deep cracks during hot weather, which helps in the proper aeration of the soil. These soils are
            sticky when wet and difficult to work on unless tilled immediately after the first shower or during the
            pre-monsoon period.
            <p></p>33] Red and Yellow Soils Red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in
            the
            eastern
            and southern parts of the Deccan plateau. Yelllow and red soils are also found in parts of Odisha,
            Chhattisgarh,
            southern parts of the middle Ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats. These soils
            develop a
            reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it occurs
            in
            a hydrated form.
            <p></p>34] Laterite Soil Laterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘later’ which means brick. The
            laterite soil
            develops under tropical and subtropical climate with alternate wet and dry season. This soil is the result
            of
            intense leaching due to heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep to very deep, acidic vegetation and in
            semi-arid environment, it is generally humus poor. They are prone to erosion and degradation due to their
            position on the landscape. After adopting appropriate soil conservation techniques particularly in the hilly
            areas of Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, this soil is very useful for growing tea and coffee. Red laterite
            soils in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala are more suitable for crops like cashew nut.
            <p></p>35] Arid Soils Arid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are generally sandy in texture and
            saline
            in
            nature. In some areas the salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by evaporating the water.
            Due to
            the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower
            horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content downwards. The Kankar
            layer formations in the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of water. After proper irrigation these
            soils
            become cultivable as has been in the case of western Rajasthan.
            <p></p>36] Forest Soils These soils are found in the hilly and mountainous areas where sufficient rain
            forests are
            available. The soils texture varies according to the mountain environment where they are formed. They are
            loamy
            and silty in valley sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes. In the snow covered areas of Himalayas,
            these
            soils experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower parts of the
            valleys particularly on the river terraces and alluvial fans are fertile.
            <p></p>37] The denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down is described as soil erosion. The
            land
            becomes
            unfit for cultivation and is known as bad land. In the Chambal basin such lands are called ravines.
            Sometimes
            water flows as a sheet over large areas down a slope. In such cases the topsoil is washed away. This is
            known as
            sheet erosion. Wind blows loose soil off flat or sloping land known as wind erosion. Ploughing along the
            contour
            lines can decelerate the flow of water down the slopes. This is called contour ploughing. Steps can be cut
            out
            on the slopes making terraces. Terrace cultivation restricts erosion. Western and central Himalayas have
            well
            developed terrace farming. Large fields can be divided into strips. Strips of grass are left to grow between
            the
            crops. This breaks up the force of the wind. This method is known as strip cropping. Planting lines of trees
            to
            create shelter also works in a similar way. Rows of such trees are called shelter belts. These shelter belts
            have contributed significantly to the stabilisation of sand dunes and in stabilising the desert in western
            India.

            <p></p>1] Belgium is a small country in Europe, smaller in area than the state of Haryana. It has borders
            with
            France,

            <p></p>7] Sri Lanka emerged as an independent country in 1948. The leaders of the Sinhala community sought
            to
            secure
            dominance over government by virtue of their majority. As a result, the democratically elected government
            adopted a series of MAJORITARIAN measures to establish Sinhala supremacy.
            <p></p>8] In 1956, an Act was passed to recognise Sinhala as the only official language, thus disregarding
            Tamil.
            The
            governments followed preferential policies that favoured Sinhala applicants for university positions and
            government jobs. A new constitution stipulated that the state shall protect and foster Buddhism.
            <p></p>9]POWER SHARING OF BELGIUM IS ACCOMMODATION.
            <p></p>10]POWER SHARIN OF SRI LANKA IS MAJORITARIANISM.
            <p></p>11]ETHNIC: A social division based on shared culture. People belonging to the same ethnic group
            believe in
            their
            common descent because of similarities of physical type or of culture or both. They need not always have the
            same religion or nationality.
            <p></p>12] Majoritarianism: A belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in
            whichever way
            it
            wants, by disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority.
            <p></p>13]SRILANKA IS THE SOUTHRN NEIGHBOURING COUNTRY,
            <p></p>14] Between 1970 and 1993, they amended their constitution four times so as to work out an
            arrangement that
            would enable everyone to live together within the same country. Here are some of the elements of the Belgian
            model:
            <p></p>1] The number of Dutch and French-speaking ministers shall be equal in the central government.
            <p></p> 2] The central government have been given to state governments of the two regions of the country.
            <p></p>3] Brussels has a separate government in which both the communities have equal representation.
            <p></p>4] Apart from the Central and the State Government, there is a third kind of government. This
            ‘community
            government’ is elected by people belonging to one language community – Dutch, French and German-speaking –
            no
            matter where they live. This government has the power regarding cultural, educational and language-related
            issues.
            <p></p>15] What do we learn from these two stories of Belgium and Sri Lanka? Both are democracies. Yet, they
            dealt
            with
            the question of power sharing differently. In Belgium, the leaders have realised that the unity of the
            country
            is possible only by respecting the feelings and interests of different communities and regions. Such a
            realisation resulted in mutually acceptable arrangements for sharing power. Sri Lanka shows us a contrasting
            example. It shows us that if a majority community wants to force its dominance over others and refuses to
            share
            power, it can undermine the unity of the country.
            <p></p>16] Thus, two different sets of reasons can be given in favour of power sharing. Firstly, power
            sharing is
            good
            because it helps to reduce the possibility of conflict between social groups. Since social conflict often
            leads
            to violence and political instability, power sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political
            order.
            <p></p>17] There is a second, deeper reason why power sharing is good for democracies. Power sharing is the
            very
            spirit
            of democracy. A democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise, and who have to
            live
            with its effects. People have a right to be consulted on how they are to be governed. A legitimate
            government is
            one where citizens, through participation, acquire a stake in the system.

            <p></p>2]ENSURE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT.
            <p></p>20] Power is shared among different organs of government, such as the legislature, executive and
            judiciary.
            Let
            us call this horizontal distribution of power because it allows different organs of government placed at the
            same level to exercise different powers.
            <p></p>21] Judges are appointed by the executive, they can check the functioning of executive or laws made
            by the
            legislatures. This arrangement is called a system of checks and balances.
            <p></p>22] Power can be shared among governments at different levels – a general government for the entire
            country
            and
            governments at the provincial or regional level. Such a general government for the entire country
            is usually called federal government. In India, we refer to it as the Central or Union Government.
            <p></p> 23] There are different levels of government, the constitution clearly lays down the powers of
            different
            levels
            of government. This is what they did in Belgium, but was refused in Sri Lanka. This is called federal
            division
            of power.
            <p></p>24] Power may also be shared among different social groups such as the religious and linguistic
            groups.
            ‘Community government’ in Belgium is a good example of this arrangement.
            <p></p>25] Power sharing arrangements can also be seen in the way political parties, pressure groups and
            movements
            control or influence those in power.
            <p></p>26] If their alliance is elected, they form a coalition government and thus share power.

            NATIONALISM IN EUROPE
            IMPORTANT POINTS:
            <p></p>1] In 1848, Frédéric Sorrieu, a French artist, prepared a series of four prints visualising his dream
            of a
            world
            made up of ‘democratic and social Republics’, as he called them.
            <p></p>2] Absolutist – Literally, a government or system of rule that has no restraints on the power
            exercised. In
            history, the term refers to a form of monarchical government that was centralised, militarised and
            repressive
            .Utopian – A vision of a society that is so ideal that it is unlikely to actually exist.
            <p></p>3] Following the German peoples are the peoples of Austria, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies,
            Lombardy,
            Poland,
            England, Ireland, Hungary and Russia.
            <p></p>4] A modern state, in which a centralised power exercised sovereign control over a clearly defined
            territory,
            had been developing over a long period of time in Europe. But a nation-state was one in which the majority
            of
            its citizens, and not only its rulers, came to develop a sense of common identity and shared history or
            descent.
            This commonness did not exist from time immemorial; it was forged through struggles, through the actions of
            leaders and the common people.
            <p></p>5] In a lecture delivered at the University of Sorbonne in 1882, the French philosopher Ernst Renan
            (1823-92)
            outlined his understanding of what makes a nation. The lecture was subsequently published as a famous essay
            entitled ‘Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?’ (‘What is a Nation?’). In this essay Renan criticises the notion
            suggested
            by others that a nation is formed by a common language, race, religion, or territory.
            <p></p>6] Plebiscite – A direct vote by which all the people of a region are asked to accept or reject a
            proposal.
            <p></p>7] The first expression of nationalism came with the French revolution in 1789.
            <p></p>8] The French Revolution led to the transfer of sovereignty from the monarchy to a body of French
            citizens.
            The
            revolution proclaimed that it was the people who would henceforth constitute the nation and shape its
            destiny.
            <p></p>9] The ideas of la patrie (the fatherland) and le citoyen (the citizen) emphasised the notion of a
            united
            community enjoying equal rights under a constitution. A new French flag, the tricolour, was chosen to
            replace
            the former royal standard. The Estates General was elected by the body of active citizens and renamed the
            National Assembly. New hymns were composed, oaths taken and martyrs commemorated, all in the name of the
            nation.
            A centralised administrative system was put in place and it formulated uniform laws for all citizens within
            its
            territory.
            <p></p>10] Regional dialects were discouraged and French, as it was spoken and written in Paris, became the
            common
            language of the nation.
            <p></p>11] Jacobin clubs. Their activities and campaigns prepared the way for the French armies which moved
            into
            Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and much of Italy in the 1790s.
            <p></p>12] Civil Code of 1804 – usually known as the Napoleonic Code – did away with all privileges based on
            birth,
            established equality before the law and secured the right to property. This Code was exported to the regions
            under French control. In the Dutch Republic, in Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified
            administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In
            the
            towns too, guild restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems were improved. Peasants,
            artisans, workers and new businessmen enjoyed a new-found freedom.
            <p></p>13] Uniform laws, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate
            the
            movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.
            <p></p> 14] Initially, in many places such as Holland and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like
            Brussels,
            Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French armies were welcomed as harbingers of liberty.
            <p></p> 15] What we know today as Germany, Italy and Switzerland were divided into kingdoms, duchies and
            cantons
            whose
            rulers had their autonomous territories. Eastern and Central Europe were under autocratic monarchies within
            the
            territories of which lived diverse peoples.
            <p></p>16] s. The Habsburg Empire that ruled over Austria-Hungary, for example, was a patchwork of many
            different
            regions and peoples. It included the Alpine regions – the Tyrol, Austria and the Sudetenland – as well as
            Bohemia, where the aristocracy was predominantly German-speaking. It also included the Italian-speaking
            provinces of Lombardy and Venetia. In Hungary, half of the population spoke Magyar while the other half
            spoke a
            variety of dialects. In Galicia, the aristocracy spoke Polish.
            <p></p>17] Bohemians and Slovaks to the north, Slovenes in Carniola, Croats to the south, and Roumans to the
            east
            in
            Transylvania. Such differences did not easily promote a sense of political unity. The only tie binding these
            diverse groups together was a common allegiance to the emperor.
            <p></p>18] Some important dates 1797 Napoleon invades Italy; Napoleonic wars begin. 1814-1815 Fall of
            Napoleon; the
            Vienna Peace Settlement. 1821 Greek struggle for independence begins. 1848 Revolutions in Europe; artisans,
            industrial workers and peasants revolt against economic hardships; middle classes demand constitutions and
            representative governments; Italians, Germans, Magyars, Poles, Czechs, etc. demand nation-states. 1859-1870
            Unification of Italy. 1866-1871 Unification of Germany. 1905 Slav nationalism gathers force in the Habsburg
            and
            Ottoman Empires.
            <p></p>19] Socially and politically, a landed aristocracy was the dominant class on the continent. The
            members of
            this
            class were united by a common way of life that cut across regional divisions. They owned estates in the
            countryside and also town-houses. They spoke French for purposes of diplomacy and in high society. Their
            families were often connected by ties of marriage. This powerful aristocracy was, however, numerically a
            small
            group. The majority of the population was made up of the peasantry.
            <p></p>20] t. Industrialisation began in England in the second half of the eighteenth century, but in France
            and
            parts
            of the German states it occurred only during the nineteenth century.
            <p></p> 21] The term ‘liberalism’ derives from the Latin root liber, meaning free. For the new middle
            classes
            liberalism
            stood for freedom for the individual and equality of all before the law. Politically, it emphasised the
            concept
            of government by consent. Since the French Revolution, liberalism had stood for the end of autocracy and
            clerical privileges, a constitution and representative government through parliament.
            <p></p>22] Yet, equality before the law did not necessarily stand for universal suffrage. You will recall
            that in
            revolutionary France, which marked the first political experiment in liberal democracy, the right to vote
            and to
            get elected was granted exclusively to property-owning men.
            <p></p> 23] In the economic sphere, liberalism stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of
            state-imposed
            restrictions on the movement of goods and capital.
            <p></p>24] Suffrage – The right to vote
            <p></p>25] s. A merchant travelling in 1833 from Hamburg to Nuremberg to sell his goods would have had to
            pass
            through
            11 customs barriers and pay a customs duty of about 5 per cent at each one of them.
            <p></p>26] The measure of cloth, for example, was the elle which in each region stood for a different
            length. An
            elle
            of textile material bought in Frankfurt would get you 54.7 cm of cloth, in Mainz 55.1 cm, in Nuremberg 65.6
            cm,
            in Freiburg 53.5 cm.
            <p></p>27] In 1834, a customs union or zollverein was formed at the initiative of Prussia and joined by most
            of the
            German states. The union abolished tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to
            two.
            <p></p> 28] Conservatism – A political philosophy that stressed the importance of tradition, established
            institutions
            and customs, and preferred gradual development to quick change.
            <p></p>29] Following the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, European governments were driven by a spirit of
            conservatism.
            <p></p> 30] Most conservatives, however, did not propose a return to the society of pre-revolutionary days.
            <p></p>31] Britain, Russia, Prussia and Austria – who had collectively defeated Napoleon, met at Vienna to
            draw up
            a
            settlement for Europe. The Congress was hosted by the Austrian Chancellor Duke Metternich.
            <p></p> 31] Treaty of Vienna of 1815 with the object of undoing most of the changes that had come about in
            Europe
            during
            the Napoleonic wars. The Bourbon dynasty, which had been deposed during the French Revolution, was restored
            to
            power, and France lost the territories it had annexed under Napoleon. A series of states were set up on the
            boundaries of France to prevent French expansion in future. Thus the kingdom of the Netherlands, which
            included
            Belgium, was set up in the north and Genoa was added to Piedmont in the south. Prussia was given important
            new
            territories on its western frontiers, while Austria was given control of northern Italy.
            <p></p>32] The main intention was to restore the monarchies that had been overthrown by Napoleon, and create
            a new
            conservative order in Europe.
            <p></p>33] Conservative regimes set up in 1815 were autocratic.
            <p></p>34] During the years following 1815, the fear of repression drove many liberal-nationalists
            underground.
            <p></p>35] Giuseppe Mazzini. Born in Genoa in 1807, he became a member of the secret society of the
            Carbonari. As a
            young man of 24, he was sent into exile in 1831 for attempting a revolution in Liguria. He subsequently
            founded
            two more underground societies, first, Young Italy in Marseilles, and then, Young Europe in Berne, whose
            members
            were like-minded young men from Poland, France, Italy and the German states. Mazzini believed that God had
            intended nations to be the natural units of mankind. So Italy could not continue to be a patchwork of small
            states and kingdoms. It had to be forged into a single unified republic within a wider alliance of nations.
            This
            unification alone could be the basis of Italian liberty. Following his model, secret societies were set up
            in
            Germany, France, Switzerland and Poland. Mazzini’s relentless opposition to monarchy and his vision of
            democratic republics frightened the conservatives. Metternich described him as ‘the most dangerous enemy of
            our
            social order’.
            <p></p>36] The first upheaval took place in France in July 1830. The Bourbon kings who had been restored to
            po wer
            during the conservative reaction after 1815, were now overthrown by liberal revolutionaries who installed a
            constitutional monarchy with Louis Philippe at its head. ‘When F rance snee zes,’ Metternich once remar ked,
            ‘the rest of Europe catches cold. ’ The July Revolution spar ked an uprising in Brussels which led to
            Belgium
            breaking away from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands .
            <p></p>37] Greece had been part of the Ottoman Empire since the fifteenth century. The growth of
            revolutionary
            nationalism in Europe spar ked off a strug gle for independence amongst the Greeks which began in 1821.
            <p></p>38] The English poet Lord Byron organised funds and later went to fight in the war, where he died of
            fever
            in
            1824. Finally, the Treaty of Constantinople of 1832 recognised Greece as an independent nation.
            <p></p>39] Culture played an important role in creating the idea of the nation: art and poetry, stories and
            music
            helped express and shape nationalist feelings .
            <p></p> 40] Romantic artists and poets generally criticised the glorification of reason and science and
            focused
            instead
            on emotions, intuition and mystical feelings.
            <p></p>41] Other Romantics such as the German philosopher Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) claimed that
            true
            German
            culture was to be discovered among the common people – das volk. It was through folk songs, folk poetry and
            folk
            dances that the true spirit of the nation (volksgeist) was popularised.
            <p></p>42] Karol Kurpinski, for example, celebrated the national struggle through his operas and music,
            turning
            folk
            dances like the polonaise and mazurka into nationalist symbols.
            <p></p>43] In 1831, an armed rebellion against Russian rule took place which was ultimately crushed.
            <p></p>44] The 1830s were years of great economic hardship in Europe.
            <p></p>45] Grimms’ Fairy Tales is a familiar name. The brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were born in the
            German
            city of
            Hanau in 1785 and 1786 respectively. While both of them studied law, they soon developed an interest in
            collecting old folktales. They spent six years travelling from village to village, talking to people and
            writing
            down fairy tales, which were handed down through the generations. These were popular both among children and
            adults. In 1812, they published their first collection of tales. Subsequently, both the brothers became
            active
            in liberal politics, especially the movement for freedom of the press. In the meantime they also published a
            33-volume dictionary of the German language. The Grimm brothers also saw French domination as a threat to
            German
            culture, and believed that the folktales they had collected were expressions of a pure and authentic German
            spirit. They considered their projects of collecting folktales and developing the German language as part of
            the
            wider effort to oppose French domination and create a German national identity.
            <p></p>46] The year 1848 was one such year. Food shortages and widespread unemployment brought the
            population of
            Paris
            out on the roads. Barricades were erected and Louis Philippe was forced to flee.
            <p></p>47] Earlier, in 1845, weavers in Silesia had led a revolt against contractors who supplied them raw
            material
            and
            gave them orders for finished textiles but drastically reduced their payments. The journalist Wilhelm Wolff
            described the events in a Silesian village as follows: In these villages (with 18,000 inhabitants) cotton
            weaving is the most widespread occupation … The misery of the workers is extreme. The desperate need for
            jobs
            has been taken advantage of by the contractors to reduce the prices of the goods they order … On 4 June at 2
            p.m. a large crowd of weavers emerged from their homes and marched in pairs up to the mansion of their
            contractor demanding higher wages. They were treated with scorn and threats alternately. Following this, a
            group
            of them forced their way into the house, smashed its elegant windowpanes, furniture, porcelain … another
            group
            broke into the storehouse and plundered it of supplies of cloth which they tore to shreds … The contractor
            fled
            with his family to a neighbouring village which, however, refused to shelter such a person. He returned 24
            hours
            later having requisitioned the army. In the exchange that followed, eleven weavers were shot.
            <p></p>48] Parallel to the revolts of the poor, unemployed and starving peasants and workers in many
            European
            countries
            in the year 1848, a revolution led by the educated middle classes was under way. Events of February 1848 in
            France had brought about the abdication of the monarch and a republic based on universal male suffrage had
            been
            proclaimed.
            <p></p>49] In the German regions a large number of political associations whose members were middle-class
            professionals, businessmen and prosperous artisans came together in the city of Frankfurt and decided to
            vote
            for an all-German National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, 831 elected representatives marched in a festive
            procession
            to take their places in the Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of St Paul. They drafted a
            constitution
            for a German nation to be headed by a monarchy subject to a parliament. When the deputies offered the crown
            on
            these terms to Friedrich Wilhelm IV, King of Prussia, he rejected it and joined other monarchs to oppose the
            elected assembly. While the opposition of the aristocracy and military became stronger, the social basis of
            parliament eroded. The parliament was dominated by the middle classes who resisted the demands of workers
            and
            artisans and consequently lost their support. In the end troops were called in and the assembly was forced
            to
            disband.
            <p></p>50] The liberal politician Carl Welcker, an elected member of the Frankfurt Parliament, expressed the
            following
            views: ‘Nature has created men and women to carry out different functions … Man, the stronger, the bolder
            and
            freer of the two, has been designated as protector of the family, its provider, meant for public tasks in
            the
            domain of law, production, defence. Woman, the weaker, dependent and timid, requires the protection of man.
            Her
            sphere is the home, the care of the children, the nurturing of the family … Do we require any further proof
            that
            given such differences, equality between the sexes would only endanger harmony and destroy the dignity of
            the
            family?’ Louise Otto-Peters (1819-95) was a political activist who founded a women’s journal and
            subsequently a
            feminist political association. The first issue of her newspaper (21 April 1849) carried the following
            editorial: ‘Let us ask how many men, possessed by thoughts of living and dying for the sake of Liberty,
            would be
            prepared to fight for the freedom of the entire people, of all human beings? When asked this question, they
            would all too easily respond with a “Yes!”, though their untiring efforts are intended for the benefit of
            only
            one half of humanity – men. But Liberty is indivisible! Free men therefore must not tolerate to be
            surrounded by
            the unfree …’ An anonymous reader of the same newspaper sent the following letter to the editor on 25 June
            1850:
            ‘It is indeed ridiculous and unreasonable to deny women political rights even though they enjoy the right to
            property which they make use of. They perform functions and assume responsibilities without however getting
            the
            benefits that accrue to men for the same … Why this injustice? Is it not a disgrace that even the stupidest
            cattle-herder possesses the right to vote, simply because he is a man, whereas highly talented women owning
            considerable property are excluded from this right, even though they contribute so much to the maintenance
            of
            the state?
            <p></p>51] Feminist – Awareness of women’s rights and interests based on the belief of the social, economic
            and
            political equality of the genders.
            <p></p>52] Frankfurt parliament convened in the Church of St Paul, women were admitted only as observers to
            stand
            in
            the visitors’ gallery. Though conservative forces were able to suppress liberal movements in 1848, they
            could
            not restore the old order.
            <p></p>53] Hence, in the years after 1848, the autocratic monarchies of Central and Eastern Europe began to
            introduce
            the changes that had already taken place in Western Europe before 1815. Thus serfdom and bonded labour were
            abolished both in the Habsburg dominions and in Russia. The Habsburg rulers granted more autonomy to the
            Hungarians in 1867.
            <p></p>54] Ideology – System of ideas reflecting a particular social and political vision.
            <p></p> 55] After 1848, nationalism in Europe moved away from its association with democracy and revolution.
            Nationalist
            sentiments were often mobilised by conservatives for promoting state power and achieving political
            domination
            over Europe.
            <p></p>56] This liberal initiative to nation-building was, however, repressed by the combined forces of the
            monarchy
            and the military, supported by the large landowners (called Junkers) of Prussia.
            <p></p>57] Otto von Bismarck, was the architect of this process carried out with the help of the Prussian
            army and
            bureaucracy. Three wars over seven years – with Austria, Denmark and France – ended in Prussian victory and
            completed the process of unification. In January 1871, the Prussian king, William I, was proclaimed German
            Emperor in a ceremony held at Versailles. On the bitterly cold morning of 18 January 1871, an assembly
            comprising the princes of the German states, representatives of the army, important Prussian ministers
            including
            the chief minister Otto von Bismarck gathered in the unheated Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles to
            proclaim the new German Empire headed by Kaiser William I of Prussia.
            <p></p>58] During the middle of the nineteenth century, Italy was divided into seven states, of which only
            one,
            Sardinia-Piedmont, was ruled by an Italian princely house.
            <p></p>59] During the 1830s, Giuseppe Mazzini had sought to put together a coherent programme for a unitary
            Italian
            Republic. He had also formed a secret society called Young Italy for the dissemination of his goals. The
            failure
            of revolutionary uprisings both in 1831 and 1848 meant that the mantle now fell on Sardinia-Piedmont under
            its
            ruler King Victor Emmanuel II to unify the Italian states through war. In the eyes of the ruling elites of
            this
            region, a unified Italy offered them the possibility of economic development and political dominance.
            <p></p>60] Chief Minister Cavour who led the movement to unify the regions of Italy was neither a
            revolutionary nor
            a
            democrat. Like many other wealthy and educated members of the Italian elite, he spoke French much better
            than he
            did Italian. Through a tactful diplomatic alliance with France engineered by Cavour, Sardinia-Piedmont
            succeeded
            in defeating the Austrian forces in 1859. Apart from regular troops, a large number of armed volunteers
            under
            the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi joined the fray. In 1860, they marched into South Italy and the Kingdom
            of
            the Two Sicilies and succeeded in winning the support of the local peasants in order to drive out the
            Spanish
            rulers. In 1861 Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of united Italy. However, much of the Italian
            population,
            among whom rates of illiteracy were very high, remained blissfully unaware of liberalnationalist ideology.
            The
            peasant masses who had supported Garibaldi in southern Italy had never heard of Italia, and believed that
            ‘La
            Talia’ was Victor Emmanuel’s wife!.
            <p></p>61] The English parliament, which had seized power from the monarchy in 1688 at the end of a
            protracted
            conflict, was the instrument through which a nation-state, with England at its centre, came to be forged.
            The
            Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland that resulted in the formation of the ‘United Kingdom of
            Great
            Britain’ meant, in effect, that England was able to impose its influence on Scotland.
            <p></p>62] After a failed revolt led by Wolfe Tone and his United Irishmen (1798), Ireland was forcibly
            incorporated
            into the United Kingdom in 1801. A new ‘British nation’ was forged through the propagation of a dominant
            English
            culture. The symbols of the new Britain – the British flag (Union Jack), the national anthem (God Save Our
            Noble
            King), the English language – were actively promoted and the older nations survived only as subordinate
            partners
            in this union.
            <p></p>63] Ethnic – Relates to a common racial, tribal, or cultural origin or background that a community
            identifies
            with or claims.
            <p></p> 64] The female figure became an allegory of the nation.
            <p></p>65] Similar female allegories were invented by artists in the nineteenth century to represent the
            nation. In
            France she was christened Marianne, a popular Christian name, which underlined the idea of a people’s
            nation.
            Her characteristics were drawn from those of Liberty and the Republic – the red cap, the tricolour, the
            cockade.
            Statues of Marianne were erected in public squares to remind the public of the national symbol of unity and
            to
            persuade them to identify with it. Marianne images were marked on coins and stamps
            <p></p>66] In visual representations, Germania wears a crown of oak leaves, as the German oak stands for
            heroism.
            <p></p>67] Allegory – When an abstract idea (for instance, greed, envy, freedom, liberty) is expressed
            through a
            person
            or a thing. An allegorical story has two meanings, one literal and one symbolic.
            <p></p> 68] By the last quarter of the nineteenth century nationalism no longer retained its idealistic
            liberal-democratic sentiment of the first half of the century, but became a narrow creed with limited ends.
            <p></p>69] The most serious source of nationalist tension in Europe after 1871 was the area called the
            Balkans. The
            Balkans was a region of geographical and ethnic variation comprising modern-day Romania, Bulgaria, Albania,
            Greece, Macedonia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Slovenia, Serbia and Montenegro whose inhabitants were
            broadly
            known as the Slavs. A large part of the Balkans was under the control of the Ottoman Empire.
            <p></p>70] the Balkan area became an area of intense conflict.
            <p></p>71] These rivalries were very evident in the way the Balkan problem unfolded. Each power – Russia,
            Germany,
            England, Austro-Hungary – was keen on countering the hold of other powers over the Balkans, and extending
            its
            own control over the area. This led to a series of wars in the region and finally the First World War.
            <p></p>72] Nationalism, aligned with imperialism, led Europe to disaster in 1914.
            <p></p>73] . The anti-imperial movements that developed everywhere were nationalist, in the sense that they
            all
            struggled to form independent nation-states, and were inspired by a sense of collective national unity,
            forged
            in confrontation with imperialism.
